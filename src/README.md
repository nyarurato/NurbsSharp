### Core
This module contains the fundamental classes and methods for NURBS representation, including knot vectors, basis

### Geometry
This module provides geometric entities such as control points, curves, and surfaces, along with their properties and methods for manipulation.

### Generation
This module includes algorithms for generating NURBS curves and surfaces from given control points and knot vectors

### Tesselation
This module handles the tessellation of NURBS surfaces into polygonal meshes for rendering and visualization purposes.

### Evaluation
This module includes algorithms for evaluating NURBS curves and surfaces at given parameter values.

### IO
This module manages input and output operations, including reading from and writing to various file formats that support NURBS data.

### Intersection
This module provides functionality for computing intersections between NURBS curves and surfaces, as well as with other geometric entities.
